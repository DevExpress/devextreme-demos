DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Dialog and Notification for React include several popup components used to&nbsp;interact with an&nbsp;app. This demo shows two of&nbsp;them: Popup and Popover. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included as&nbsp;well.
