The DevExtreme Navigation components support right-to-left (RTL) languages. The components can display the contents in a right-to-left direction and mirror associated UI elements. 

To enable RTL language support in the application, you can either set the [globalConfig]() object's [rtlEnabled]() property to **true** or specify each component's **rtlEnabled** property individually. Note that individual RTL parameters have higher priority than the general ones.

In this demo, you can use the language drop-down menu (change from English to Arabic) to explore the differences between default and RTL modes.
