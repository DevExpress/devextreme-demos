It is optimized for multi-dimensional data analysis and supports binding to data from local arrays and OLAP cubes (MS SQL Server Analysis Services), as well as custom remote services. PivotGrid's key features include: several summary calculation modes, customizable layout, data sorting and exporting, and integration with DevExtreme Chart, which is shown in this demo.
