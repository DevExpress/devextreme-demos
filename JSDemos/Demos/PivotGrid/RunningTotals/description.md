The **PivotGrid** widget is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;display running total values next to&nbsp;summary cells. The widget can perform cross-group accumulation of&nbsp;running total values or&nbsp;accumulate them within each group separately. The **PivotGrid** also allows you to combine the field's values into groups for the headers via the [selector](Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/#selector) property. And it also allows you to specify a custom [post-processing function](Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/#calculateSummaryValue) for summary values.
Finaly, this demo illustrates how you can customize the appearance of cells via the [onCellPrepared](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/#onCellPrepared) callback.
