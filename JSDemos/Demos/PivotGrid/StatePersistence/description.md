The PivotGrid can persist the current state and save it to a storage. The state includes fields configuration, filters, sort orders, expanded headers, and summary display modes.

To configure state persistence, use the [stateStoring](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/) object. Set this object's [enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#enabled) field to **true** to enable this feature. Specify the [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#type) property to select a storage type to keep the component's state and [storageKey](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#storageKey) to access the storage. In this demo, we use `localStorage` and the `dx-widget-gallery-pivotgrid-storing` key.

You can get or set the PivotGrid's state programmatically. Use the **PivotGridDataSource**.[state()](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Methods/#state) or [state(state)](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Methods/#statestate) method respectively for this purpose. This demo uses the **state(state)** method with an empty object as an argument to reset the PivotGrid's state. 

PivotGrid allows you to implement [customSave](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customSave) and [customLoad](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customLoad) functions to configure save and load operations from scratch. These functions apply only when the storage type is *"custom"*.
