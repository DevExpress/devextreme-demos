When bare facts are not enough to&nbsp;present your data in&nbsp;the best possible way, turn them into an&nbsp;eye-catching animated chart using the Chart component. This demo illustrates this component coordinating with the PivotGrid component. Expand a&nbsp;column or&nbsp;row in&nbsp;the PivotGrid for the Chart to&nbsp;show data of&nbsp;the lowest expanded level.
