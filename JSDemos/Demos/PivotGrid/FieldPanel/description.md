The PivotGrid allows its users to&nbsp;sort and filter data, or&nbsp;manage the collection of&nbsp;fields at&nbsp;runtime. All these operations can be&nbsp;performed using the field panel located at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the component. Click the sorting or&nbsp;filtering icon of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the fields to&nbsp;sort or&nbsp;filter data by&nbsp;this field. Right-click the &laquo;Sales&raquo; field and select an&nbsp;item from the appeared context menu to&nbsp;change the summary type. Drag and drop the fields to&nbsp;rearrange them.
