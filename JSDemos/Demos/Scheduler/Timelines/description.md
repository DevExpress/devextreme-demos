Timeline views display appointments as a sequence of events on a horizontal timeline, as opposed to basic views that display appointments in a calendar-like fashion. You can use the View Switcher above the timetable to switch between the views.

To add timeline views to your Scheduler, list them in the [views](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/) array. You can also set the initially selected view in the [currentView](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#currentView) property.

For information about all supported view types, refer to the [View Types](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/Views/View_Types/) help topic.

In this demo, appointments are colored and grouped according to their resources. For information on how to configure resources and group appointments by them, view the following demos:
