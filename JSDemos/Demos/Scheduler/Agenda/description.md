The Agenda view shows appointments in a stack. This view does not render timetable cells. This allows the Scheduler to save screen space and display appointments more compactly.

To add the Agenda view to your Scheduler, declare it in the [views](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/) array.

[note] The Agenda view does not allow a user to add appointments or modify them by dragging.

For more information about Agenda and other supported views, refer to the [View Types](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Scheduler/Views/View_Types/) help topic.
