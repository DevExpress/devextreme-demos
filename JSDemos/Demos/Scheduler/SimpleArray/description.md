In&nbsp;this demo, the Scheduler component visualizes data stored in&nbsp;an&nbsp;in-memory array. The component is&nbsp;bound to&nbsp;this array using the **dataSource** property. Note that object structure complies with the Default Item Structure, that&nbsp;is, each object has the **text**, **startDate** and **endDate** fields.
