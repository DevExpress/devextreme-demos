If [resources](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/resources/) are assigned to appointments, you can group them by these resources. To do this, specify the [groups](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/groups.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#groups') array. Each element of this array is [fieldExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/resources/#fieldExpr) of a resource kind. Note that the order of resource fields depends on the order of elements in the **resources** array.

The Scheduler arranges group headers vertically (in a column) or horizontally (in a row). This depends on the view [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#type). You can use the **views**.[groupOrientation](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/views/groupOrientation.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#groupOrientation') property to set custom orientation for specific views.
