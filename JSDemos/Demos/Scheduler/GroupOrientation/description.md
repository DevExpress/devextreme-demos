[Resources](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/resources/) are categories used to classify appointments. To understand what resources are, consider the following example: in an educational center lectures are held in several rooms; in Scheduler terms, room is a resource kind, individual rooms are resource instances, and lectures are appointments that use these resource instances.

The [Resources demo](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/Resources/) describes how to assign resources. When assigned, they can also be used to group appointments. To implement this, specify the [groups[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#groups) property. Each element of this array is [fieldExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/resources/#fieldExpr) of a resource kind. The order of resource headers in the UI is the same as the order of the resource instances. Note that if the **resources** array has more than one element, grouping is nested. 

The Scheduler arranges group headers vertically (in a column) or horizontally (in a row). You can use the **views**.[groupOrientation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#groupOrientation) property to set custom orientation for specific views. This property description includes default view orientation types.
