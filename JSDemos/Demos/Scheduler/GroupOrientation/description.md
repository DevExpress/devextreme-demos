If resources are assigned to appointments, you can group them by these resources. To do so, use the [groups](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/groups.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#groups') property to specify an array. Each element of this array is **fieldExpr** of a resource kind. Note that the resource headers' order depends on the resources' order in the [resources](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/resources '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/resources/') array.

The Scheduler arranges group headers vertically (in a column) or horizontally (in a row). This depends on the view type. You can use the **views**.[groupOrientation](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/views/groupOrientation.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#groupOrientation') property to set custom orientation for specific views.
