To customize a view, configure its settings in an object inside the [views[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views) array. You should specify the view's [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#type) and other properties to override global view settings.

This demo shows four views, two of which (Week and Work Week) are customized. Both customized views [group appointments](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/GroupOrientation/) by [resources](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/Resources/) and use the [dateCellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#dateCellTemplate) to change the appearance of date cells. In addition, the [startDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#startDayHour) and [endDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#endDayHour) properties are used to narrow down the time window on the Work Week view.
