To add a customized view, create an object in the [views[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views) array. In this object, you should specify the view's [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#type) and other properties that will override global Scheduler configuration.

This demo has two customized views: *"week"* and *"workWeek"*. What differs them
is that they group appointments by resources and set the [dateCellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#dateCellTemplate). In addition, the *"workWeek"* view specifies the [startDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#startDayHour) and [endDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#endDayHour) values.
