In&nbsp;this demo, the _&laquo;Week&raquo;_ and _&laquo;Work Week&raquo;_ views of&nbsp;the **Scheduler** UI component are configured individually. The appointments are grouped by&nbsp;type (on&nbsp;the _&laquo;Week&raquo;_ view) and by&nbsp;priority (on&nbsp;the _&laquo;Work Week&raquo;_ view). In&nbsp;addition, the time window on&nbsp;the _&laquo;Work Week&raquo;_ view is&nbsp;narrowed down to&nbsp;working hours.
