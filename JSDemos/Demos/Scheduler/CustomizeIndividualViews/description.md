To customize a view, specify its settings in an object in the [views[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views) array. You should specify the view's [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#type) and other properties that override global Scheduler configuration.

This demo has two customized views: *"week"* and *"workWeek"*. They group appointments by resources and specify the [dateCellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#dateCellTemplate). In addition, the *"workWeek"* view specifies the [startDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#startDayHour) and [endDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#endDayHour) values.
