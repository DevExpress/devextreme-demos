This example demonstrates the Scheduler component communicating with a&nbsp;Web API service. All data editing and data processing operations are delegated to&nbsp;the server. The [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data) extension&rsquo;s **DevExpress.data.AspNet.createStore** method configures access to&nbsp;the server from the client. The server implementation is&nbsp;available under the _SchedulerDataController_ tab in&nbsp;the ASP.NET MVC version of&nbsp;this demo.
