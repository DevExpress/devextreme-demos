The **Scheduler** allows its users to view appointments in different time zones. Set the [timeZone](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#timeZone) option to specify the current time zone. This option accepts values from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" target="_blank">IANA time zone database</a>.

In this demo, you can use the drop-down menu above the **Scheduler** to choose between the London, Berlin, and Helsinki time zones. Note that the time zone offset indicated in the drop-down menu may differ from the applied offset due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time" target="_blank">daylight saving time</a>.

Users can edit the time zones of individual appointments in the appointment details form. To enable this functionality, set the **editing**.[allowTimeZoneEditing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/editing/#allowTimeZoneEditing) option to **true**. Information about individual time zones is saved in the [startDateTimeZone](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/dxSchedulerAppointment/#startDateTimeZone) and [endDateTimeZone](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/dxSchedulerAppointment/#endDateTimeZone) fields of the appointment data objects. However, appointments retain their positions if you change individual time zones, because the **timeZone** option takes precedence over the **start**/**endDateTimeZone** fields. (We plan to reconsider this behavior in upcoming releases.)
