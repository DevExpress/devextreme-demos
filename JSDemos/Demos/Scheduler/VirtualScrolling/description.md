With virtual scrolling, you can improve the overall performance of your application and reduce load times when our **Scheduler** UI component is bound to a large data set. When virtual scrolling is enabled, our **Scheduler** only renders visible appointments. When an appointment leaves the viewport, the **Scheduler** removes it from the DOM. The data set in this demo contains 100 groups with 9 appointments each.

To enable virtual scrolling mode, set the [scrolling](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/scrolling).[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/scrolling/#mode) option to *"virtual"*.

Virtual scrolling support is available in the following **Scheduler** [views](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/): *"day"*, *"week"*, and *"workWeek"*.
