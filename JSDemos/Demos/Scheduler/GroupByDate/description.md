If appointments are grouped by a resource, you can additionally group them by date first. To do this, set [groupByDate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#groupByDate) to **true**. Applies only when the view's [groupOrientation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/views/#groupOrientation) is *"horizontal"*.

In this demo, you can use the switch below the Scheduler to toggle the value of **groupByDate**.
