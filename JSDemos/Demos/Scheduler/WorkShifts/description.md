This demo shows how to use the [offset](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#offset) property that specifies the minute offset within Scheduler, indicating the starting point of a day. The offset is a multiple of 5 and can range from -1440 minutes (-24 hours) to 1440 minutes (24 hours). 

For instance, if you set the offset to -120, like the **First shift** in the demo, the day starts at 10:00 PM on the previous day instead of 00:00. If you set the offset to 360, like the **Second shift**, the day starts at 6:00 AM.

You can also combine this property with [startDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#startDayHour), [endDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#endDayHour), and [cellDuration](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScheduler/Configuration/#cellDuration) to get the necessary result.
