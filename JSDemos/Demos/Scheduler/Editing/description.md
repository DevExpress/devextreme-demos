Scheduler allows users to add, edit, resize, drag, and delete appointments. The editing object consists of properties that allow you to configure these operations. Below is a list of them and their default values:

* allowAdding (true)
* allowDeleting (true)
* allowUpdating (true)
* allowResizing (true, false (Android, iOS))
* allowDragging (true, false (Android, iOS))
* allowTimeZoneEditing (false).

In this demo, the checkboxes below the Scheduler allow you to toggle these operations.
