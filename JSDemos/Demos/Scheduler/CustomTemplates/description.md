This demo illustrates the rich collection of&nbsp;the appearance customization options available as&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the **Scheduler** UI component. The appearance of&nbsp;appointments and appointment tooltips are defined using custom templates. Options for the appointment details form are set within the **appointmentFormOpening** event handler. Options for the **Scheduler** are also modified: the **timelineDay** view is&nbsp;added to&nbsp;the _View Selector_ and the _All-day panel_ is&nbsp;hidden.
