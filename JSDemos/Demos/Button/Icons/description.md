To add an icon to **Button**, use the UI component's **icon** property. This demo covers the following use cases of this property:   

- **Built-in icons**    
DevExtreme comes with an [icon library](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/#Built-In_Icon_Library). Set the **icon** property to the relevant icon name.    

- **Image icons**    
Set the **icon** value to the image file path or URI.    

- **External icon fonts**   
It is possible to import an external font library. In this case, use **icon** names taken from the library. Refer to the library's documentation for proper icon names. This example uses <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.    

- **Icon without a text**   
Define the **icon** but do not define the **text** property.    

Refer to the [Icons](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons) help topic for additional information.
