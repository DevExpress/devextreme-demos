To add an icon to **Button** use the UI component's **icon** property. This demo covers the following use cases:   

- **Built-in icons**    
Make use of the built-in DevExtreme icon [library](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/) by assigning the relevant icon name to the **icon** property.    

- **Image icons**    
Pass the image file path or URI to the UI component's **icon** property.    

- **External icon**   
You may choose to import an external font library. In this case, refer to its documentation for proper icon names. This example makes use of [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery), therefore the icon names provided herein are specific to this library.    

- **Icon only**   
Do not define the **text** property to achieve this.    

Additionally, you can disable buttons by setting the **disabled** parameter to *true*.
