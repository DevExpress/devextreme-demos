**Button** supports five [types](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Button/Customize_the_Appearance/) and three styling [modes](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxButton/Configuration/#stylingMode). The **type** property defines the color while the **stylingMode** property affects the fill and borders.   

Note: The *back* button type is identical to *normal* with an icon in place of text.
