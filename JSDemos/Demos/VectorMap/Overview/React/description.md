DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript Maps include two interactive React components for creating GPS navigation maps and vector maps. The Map UI component works with Google Maps and Bing Maps API, supports roadmap, satellite, and hybrid views, and allows a&nbsp;user to&nbsp;create markers and routes. The Vector Map UI component comes with predefined data sources, a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;colorization modes, and multiple legends. Advanced UI&nbsp;customization is&nbsp;carried out using template components and [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html). Declared [PropTypes for typechecking](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) are included as&nbsp;well.
