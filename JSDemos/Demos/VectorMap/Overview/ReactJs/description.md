DevExtreme React Maps include two interactive UI components for creating GPS navigation maps and vector maps. The Map component works with Google Maps and Bing Maps API, supports roadmap, satellite, and hybrid views, and allows a user to create markers and routes. The Vector Map component comes with predefined data sources, a variety of colorization modes, and multiple legends.
