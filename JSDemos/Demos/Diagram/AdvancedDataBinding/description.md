The **Diagram** UI component accepts functions as expression property values.  It allows you to implement custom logic when you bind a diagram to a data source.
In this demo, the [nodes](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/nodes/) and [edges](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/edges/) collections are bound to a data source. Custom functions are used to get different shape types and font styles for items based on additional data source information.

The [autoLayout](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/nodes/autoLayout/) option specifies an auto-layout algorithm type and orientation that the UI component uses to build diagrams.
