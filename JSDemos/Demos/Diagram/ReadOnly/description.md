The **Diagram** UI component can operate in Read Only mode. In this mode, users are not permitted to edit a diagram; therefore, most of the UI elements are disabled. It is for this reason that the Toolbox and Properties panel in this demo are hidden.

To switch the **Diagram** to Read Only mode, set the [readOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/#readOnly) option to true.
