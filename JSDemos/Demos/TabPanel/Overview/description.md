The TabPanel is&nbsp;a&nbsp;UI component consisting of&nbsp;the Tabs and the MultiView components. It&nbsp;automatically synchronizes the selected tab with the currently displayed view and vice versa. In&nbsp;this demo, the appearance of&nbsp;views and tabs is&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;custom templates.
