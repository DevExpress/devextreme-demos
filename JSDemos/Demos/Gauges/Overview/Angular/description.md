DevExtreme Angular Gauge controls help you visualize data and create dashboards. Our library includes three gauge types: radial bar gauges, circular scale gauges, and linear gauges. 

This demo displays a simple dashboard with a few highly customized gauges. 

Review other demos in this section to explore gauge features such as geometry customization, palettes, tooltips, and custom label display.

Our gauge controls also support Native Angular features: AOT compilation, declarative configuration, and TypeScript compile-time checking.
