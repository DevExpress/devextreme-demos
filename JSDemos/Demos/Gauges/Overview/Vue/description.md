DevExtreme Vue Gauge controls are animated UI components designed for use in dashboards. The gauges can be of two geometric shapes: circular, or radial, and linear. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to instantiate and configure the gauges or handle their events. In addition, the components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation).
