DevExtreme Vue Gauge controls are animated UI components designed for use in&nbsp;dashboards. The gauges can be&nbsp;of&nbsp;two geometric shapes: circular, or&nbsp;radial, and linear. You can use Vue syntax and techniques to&nbsp;instantiate and configure the gauges or&nbsp;handle their events. In&nbsp;addition, the components support [prop validation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#Prop-Validation).
