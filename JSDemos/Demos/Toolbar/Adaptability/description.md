This demo demonstrates how the Toolbar component can adapt to different screen widths.

To see step-by-step instructions on how to get started with the DevExtreme Toolbar component, refer to the following tutorial: [Getting Started with Toolbar](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Toolbar/Getting_Started_with_Toolbar/). 

In this demo, you can drag the Toolbar container's resizing handle to emulate the component's behavior on different screens. In single-line mode (default), the Toolbar does not wrap and displays an overflow menu with items that do not fit into the container. Use the [locateInMenu](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxToolbar/Configuration/items/#locateInMenu) property to control whether an item appears in the overflow menu.

If the Toolbar's width exceeds the container's width and you enable the [multiline](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxToolbar/Configuration/#multiline) property, the component wraps onto multiple lines.
