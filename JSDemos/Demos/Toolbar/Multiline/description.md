This demo demonstrates the multiline mode in the Toolbar component. To see step-by-step instructions on how to get started with the DevExtreme Toolbar component, refer to the following tutorial: [Getting Started with Toolbar](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Toolbar/Getting_Started_with_Toolbar/). 

In this demo, drag the handle of the component container on the right to resize the Toolbar. If you enable the [multiline](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxToolbar/Configuration/#multiline) property, the Toolbar is displayed in multiple lines after resize. The number of lines is restricted by the minimum width of the container.

In the single line mode (the [multiline](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxToolbar/Configuration/#multiline) property is false), if the [locateInMenu](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxToolbar/Configuration/items/#locateInMenu) property of the item is set to `auto`, the item hides in the overflow menu with the width decrease.
