This example demonstrates a&nbsp;TreeList component that supports focused rows. The&nbsp;**focusedRowKey** property specifies the&nbsp;focused row. The **onFocusedRowChanged** callback function can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;display additional information below the&nbsp;TreeList when the&nbsp;focused row changes. The **focusedRowEnabled** property enables row focusing.
