Batch editing is&nbsp;very similar to&nbsp;cell editing in&nbsp;that a&nbsp;user edits data cell by&nbsp;cell. The only difference is&nbsp;that with batch editing a&nbsp;user needs to&nbsp;click the _&laquo;Save changes&raquo;_ button to&nbsp;actually save changes. Only then the TreeList will collect all changes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;batch and send them to&nbsp;the data source.
