You can use batch edit mode to defer saving multiple changes. In this mode, users edit data one cell at a time. The changes are stored in a buffer and can be discarded before the **Save** button is clicked.

To enable batch edit mode, set the [mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#mode) property to *"batch"* and enable the [editing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#mode) object's [allowUpdating](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowUpdating), [allowAdding](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowAdding), and [allowDeleting](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowDeleting) properties to allow edit operations.

This demo also uses the [onInitNewRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/#onInitNewRow) handler to populate cells of a new row with default values. This function sets Not Started and as the initial task status and specifies the current date as the initial start and due dates.

If you store data on the server that has a custom backend logic to apply data changes, implement the [onSaving](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/#onSaving) client-side function to save all changes with a single request as done in the DataGrid's [Batch Update Request](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/BatchUpdateRequest/jQuery/Light/) demo.
