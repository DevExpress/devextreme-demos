This demo shows how to&nbsp;enable paging and configure the pager, an&nbsp;element that allows you to&nbsp;navigate through pages and change their size. The pager consists of&nbsp;several elements, such as&nbsp;the page navigator, page size selector, and other elements whose availability is&nbsp;defined within the [pager](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/pager/) object.
