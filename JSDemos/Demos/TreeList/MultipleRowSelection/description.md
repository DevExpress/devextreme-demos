In&nbsp;this demo, the TreeList component uses the multiple selection mode. To&nbsp;select a&nbsp;row, click the check box located in&nbsp;this row. Note that selection is&nbsp;non-recursive by&nbsp;default, that&nbsp;is, only the clicked row is&nbsp;selected, but not its nested rows. To&nbsp;make it&nbsp;recursive, click the _&laquo;Recursive Selection&raquo;_ check box under the TreeList. You can also select all rows at&nbsp;once by&nbsp;clicking the check box in&nbsp;the column header.
