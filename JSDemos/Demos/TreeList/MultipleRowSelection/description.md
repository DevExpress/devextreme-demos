This demo sets **selection**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/selection/#mode) to *"multiple"*. This allows users to select multiple rows using checkboxes or keyboard shortcuts.  Note that the default selection mode is non-recursive, that is, only the clicked row is selected. To allow users to select the dependent rows, set **selection**.[recursive](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/selection/#recursive) to **true**. In this demo, you can use the control under the TreeList to toggle this mode.

Click the checkbox in the leftmost column header to select all rows. If you do not need this default feature, set the [allowSelectAll](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/selection/#allowSelectAll) property to **false**.

The TreeList has an API to select multiple rows. For details, refer to the [Selection API](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/TreeList/Selection/#API) article.
