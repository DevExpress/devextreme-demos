The [Filter panel](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterPanel/) is a UI element that displays the combined filter situated in the bottom of the TreeList. This filter is stored in the [filterValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterValue) property and consists of [custom filters](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/customOperations) and filters that users apply in the UI elements ([filter row](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterRow/), [header filter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/headerFilter/), [filterBuilder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilder)).

To display the filter panel, set the **filterPanel**.[visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterPanel/#visible) property to **true**. 

A click on the combined filter calls the integrated filter builder. You can configure it in the [filterBuilder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilder) object. You can also click the check box to toggle the current filter. The filter values are always reflected in the filter row.

DataGrid uses the DevExtreme [Popup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/) component to display the integrated filter builder. The popup's default configuration is defined automatically, but you can change it in the [filterBuilderPopup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilderPopup) object.
