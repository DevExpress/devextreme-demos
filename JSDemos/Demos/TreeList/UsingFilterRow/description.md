The filter row allows users to enter a query for each column and filter rows by that value. To enable this behavior, set **filterRow**.[visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/filterRow/#visible) to **true**. This feature can be combined with the [header filter](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/UsingHeaderFilter).

Each cell in the filter row contains a magnifying glass icon that opens a drop-down list with available filters. These filters and their initial setting are defined by the column's [data type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columns/#dataType). You can use the [selectedFilterOperation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columns/#selectedFilterOperation) property to specify a custom initial filter operation.

The default behavior is to display the matched rows and their ancestors. The [Filter Modes](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/FilterModes) demo shows how to use other display modes.
