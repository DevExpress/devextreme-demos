This demo shows how you can filter data using the filter row. Its cells allow filtering by&nbsp;individual columns. Select or&nbsp;type a&nbsp;value into a&nbsp;cell of&nbsp;the filter row. If&nbsp;this value is&nbsp;found in&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the rows, the TreeList displays the full hierarchy down to&nbsp;them, but not further. In&nbsp;addition, you can choose the current filter operation from the drop-down menu that opens when you hover over the magnifying glass icon.
