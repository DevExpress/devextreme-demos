To enable the row editing mode, set the **editing**.[mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#mode) property to *"row"*.

All edit operations are deactivated in the default configuration. To activate them, set the [allowAdding](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowAdding), [allowUpdating](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowUpdating), and [allowDeleting](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/editing/#allowDeleting) properties of the editing object to **true**. This will create the edit column with buttons for each allowed operation on each row. In this demo, we declared a column of type *"buttons"* to add the edit and delete buttons only; the universal button to add a new row is situated in the upper right corner of the demo container. See the [Customize the Edit Column](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/TreeList/Columns/Column_Types/Command_Columns/#Customize_the_Edit_Column) article for details.

Each edit operation raises events. In this demo, we use the [onInitNewRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/#onInitNewRow) handler to configure the creation of a new row: the Head of a new employee is prepopulated with the company's CEO. We also use the [onEditorPreparing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/#onEditorPreparing) handler to customize the edit form: if a user edits the row with the CEO, the TreeList will disable the Head column editor.
