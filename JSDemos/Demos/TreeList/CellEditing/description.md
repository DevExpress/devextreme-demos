This example demonstrates editing in _&laquo;cell&raquo;_ mode. A&nbsp;click on&nbsp;any cell switches it&nbsp;into the editing state. Once you click outside the cell, the **TreeList** saves your changes. Note that several columns are made uneditable by&nbsp;setting their **allowEditing** property to _false_.
