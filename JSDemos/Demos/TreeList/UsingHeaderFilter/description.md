This demo shows how to&nbsp;use the header filter for filtering data. The header filter contains a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;unique column values that you can select. To&nbsp;open this list, click the filter icon in&nbsp;a&nbsp;column header. Once you select a&nbsp;value from this list and click&nbsp;OK, the filter is&nbsp;applied, and the TreeList displays the full hierarchy down to&nbsp;matching rows, but not further.
