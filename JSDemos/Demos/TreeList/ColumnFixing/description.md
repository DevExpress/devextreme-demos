If&nbsp;the TreeList contains many columns, they may exceed the width of&nbsp;the component and cause horizontal scrolling. At&nbsp;the same time, some pivotal columns should be&nbsp;on&nbsp;screen no&nbsp;matter how far the TreeList is&nbsp;scrolled. Such columns can be&nbsp;fixed to&nbsp;the right or&nbsp;to&nbsp;the left of&nbsp;the TreeList using the context menu appearing when a&nbsp;user right-clicks a&nbsp;column header.
