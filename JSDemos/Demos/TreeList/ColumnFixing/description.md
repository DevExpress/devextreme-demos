When the width of all columns exceeds the component's width, horizontal scrolling occurs. TreeList allows to fix certain columns to the right or left so they would always be visible on scroll. To enable this feature, set **columnFixing**.[enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columnFixing/#enabled) to **true**.

To fix a column programmatically, set its [fixed](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columns/#fixed) property to **true**. The default position is TreeList's left, but you can set the column's [fixedPosition](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columns/#fixedPosition) property to *"right"*.

To fix/unfix a column in the UI, users should right-click the column's header to open the context menu and choose the desired operation. If some column should never be fixed or unfixed, set its [allowFixing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columns/#allowFixing) to **false**.
