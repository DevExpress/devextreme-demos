The search panel allows users to filter data by all columns. If at least one row field matches the query, the TreeList displays such row with its ancestors. To enable this feature, set **searchPanel**.[visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/searchPanel/#visible) to **true**.

The default behavior is to search by [visible and invisible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/columns/#visible) columns. If you want to search by visible columns only, set the **searchPanel**.[searchVisibleColumnsOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Configuration/searchPanel/#searchVisibleColumnsOnly) property to **true**.

For available display modes of parent/child nodes, see the [Filter Modes](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/FilterModes) demo.
