The search panel allows users to filter through all data: if at least one row field matches the query, the TreeList will display the corresponding record with its ancestors. To enable this feature, set **searchPanel**.[visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/searchPanel/#visible) to **true**. The [Filter Modes](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/FilterModes) demo shows the available display modes for parent/child nodes.

The default behavior is to search by all columns. If you want to search by visible columns only, set [searchVisibleColumnsOnly](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/searchPanel/#searchVisibleColumnsOnly) to **true**.
