This demo shows how to&nbsp;filter data by&nbsp;all columns, that&nbsp;is, to&nbsp;perform search. Type a&nbsp;search string into the search panel located in&nbsp;the top-right corner. The TreeList tries to&nbsp;find entries of&nbsp;your search string in&nbsp;the rows. If&nbsp;such entries are found, the TreeList displays the full hierarchy down to&nbsp;matching rows, but not further.
