DevExtreme JavaScript Tree List is an adaptive UI component optimized for visualizing hierarchical data in a grid. Tree List is available for AngularJS and thus supports two-way binding to scope properties and declarative configuration. This example shows a slightly customized Tree List with selection, filtering, and column rearranging enabled. See other demos in this section for an overview of other Tree List features, like data binding, several editing modes, searching with a search panel, etc.
