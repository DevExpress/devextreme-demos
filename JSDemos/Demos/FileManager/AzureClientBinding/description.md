This demo illustrates how to use the custom file provider to connect the **FileManager** UI component to the Azure Blob Storage on the client side. The [Custom File System Provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileManager/File_System_Providers/Custom) allows you to implement custom APIs to handle file operations (add, delete, rename, etc.). All APIs that implement access to Azure Blob Storage on the client are stored in the <a href="https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/JSDemos/Demos/FileUploader/AzureDirectUploading/azure-file-system.js" target="_blank">azure-file-system.js</a> file. On the server, configure the [Shared Access Signature (SAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) to grant access to blobs in the storage.
