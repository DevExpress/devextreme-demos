**List** can display items as a two-level hierarchy - parent and child items. To group items, set the [grouped](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#grouped) property to **true** and make sure that the data source defines the hierarchy in one of the following ways. 

### Hierarchical Data Source Structure

You can use a **dataSource** where each entry is an object that contains two fields: **key** and **items**. The **key** field specifies the group header (parent), and the **items** field holds an array of child items. This demo shows how to use such a data source.

A data source can specify different field names as long as the data is structured in the same manner. If that's the case, implement the DataSource's [map](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#map) function to create **key** and **items** field mappings. Refer to the following help topic for more information: [Item Mapping](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Data_Layer/#Reading_Data/Data_Transformation/Item_Mapping).

### Grouping Field

The data source can contain a plain list of objects with multiple fields. Assign a field to the [DataSource](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/)'s [group](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#group) property to create a hierarchical display. Parent items will display unique values from the specified field. Child items will display grouped values. 

- The [grouped](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#grouped) property is set to **true**.    

If you need to make the groups collapsible, set the [collapsibleGroups](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#collapsibleGroups) to **true**. 

You can also customize the look of group headers. To do so, use the [groupTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#groupTemplate) property.
