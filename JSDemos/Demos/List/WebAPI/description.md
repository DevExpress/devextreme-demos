To access a Web API service from the client, use the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/client-side-with-jquery.md#api-reference" target="_blank">createStore</a> method which is part of the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data#devextreme-aspnet-data" target="_blank">DevExtreme.AspNet.Data</a> extension. This extension also allows you to process data for DevExtreme UI components <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/server-side-configuration.md" target="_blank">on the server</a>. The server-side implementation is available under the `ListDataController.cs` tab in the [ASP.NET MVC version of this demo](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/List/WebApi/Mvc/Light/).
