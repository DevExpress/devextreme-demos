The **List** supports item customization. You can use predefined customization settings. To do so, define [specific fields](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/items/) in item data object.

In cases when you need deeper customization, implement a custom template and assign it to the [itemTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#itemTemplate) property, as illustrated in this demo.
