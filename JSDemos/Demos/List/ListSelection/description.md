The **List** offers three selection modes: *all*, *single* and *multi*. The UI of this demo consists of the **List**, Selected IDs, and Options. To see selection modes in action, choose one from the dropdown menu named Selection Mode. You can then select a list item or multiple items from the **List**. You can see the IDs of selected items in the Selected IDs section. This done by a function that handles the [onSelectionChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxList/Configuration/#onSelectionChanged) event.

Check a checkbox a radio button next to a list item to select it. This is possible because the [showSelectionControls](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxList/Configuration/#showSelectionControls) property is set to **true**. Set the property to **false** to disable selection controls. In this case, you can click on items you want to select. Selected items are grayed out. 

When you choose a selection mode from the dropdown menu, the value you select is assigned to the [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxList/Configuration/#selectionMode) property. When you choose *all*, "Select all" checkbox is rendered at the top of the **List**. This value only works when **showSelectionControls** is set to **true**. In this mode, the "Select All Mode" dropdown menu becomes active. When you choose the *page* option, this value is assigned to the [selectAllMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#selectAllMode) property. This allows you to select all items only on the currently rendered page. To select all items on all available pages, set this property to *allPAges*. 

Select the *multiple* mode to be able to check several checkboxes at the same time. 

Or use the *single* mode if you need to select only one item at a time. In this case, the selection is controlled with radio buttons.
