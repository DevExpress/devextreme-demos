The TreeMap component provides a&nbsp;flexible system of&nbsp;tile colorization. You can assign colors to&nbsp;tiles depending on&nbsp;their values or&nbsp;the group they belong&nbsp;to. If&nbsp;colors are specified in&nbsp;your data source, you can use them as&nbsp;well. Finally, the TreeMap includes nine built-in palettes that ensure the superb appearance.
