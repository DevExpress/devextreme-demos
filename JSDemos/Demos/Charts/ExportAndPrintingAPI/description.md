DevExtreme JavaScript Data Visualization UI components fulfill their purpose even outside the browser, thanks to&nbsp;the client-side export and printing features. This demo illustrates the **exportTo** and **print** API methods used for exporting and printing from code. Below the **Chart**, you see the _&laquo;Print&raquo;_ and _&laquo;Export&raquo;_ buttons. A&nbsp;click on&nbsp;the _&laquo;Print&raquo;_ button calls the Print Dialog Window with a&nbsp;document ready to&nbsp;be&nbsp;printed. In&nbsp;this window, you can change printing properties and send the document to&nbsp;your printer. A&nbsp;click on&nbsp;the _&laquo;Export&raquo;_ button saves a&nbsp;PNG file with the UI component in&nbsp;your local storage. PDF, JPEG, SVG, and GIF formats are supported as&nbsp;well.
