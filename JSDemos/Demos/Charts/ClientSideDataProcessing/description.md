The DevExtreme HTML5 Widgets can get data from a&nbsp;remote storage and process it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the client. This demo shows the **Chart** UI component whose data source loads all data from a&nbsp;remote JSON file in&nbsp;one query. Afterwards, different filters are applied to&nbsp;this data depending on&nbsp;a&nbsp;value of&nbsp;the drop-down menu under the chart.
