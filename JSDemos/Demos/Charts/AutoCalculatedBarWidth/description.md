When you have multiple [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Series_Types/BarSeries/), values for some of their points can be unspecified or set to zero. Bars for these points are not displayed, but space for them remains reserved. This results in gaps.

The [ignoreEmptyPoints](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Series_Types/BarSeries/#ignoreEmptyPoints) option allows you to prevent this behavior. If you set it to **true**, the neighbouring bars increase their width, thus filling the gaps. In this demo, you can see the option's effect on the example of the `Iran`, `Canada`, `Saudi Arabia`, and `Mexico` arguments.
