To [aggregate](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Chart/Data_Aggregation/) points on discrete axes, do the following steps:

1. Enable aggregation.    
You can enable data aggregation for individual series, all series of a specific type, or for all series in the Chart. Assign `true` to the [aggregation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/aggregation/).[enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/aggregation/#enabled) property.
In this demo, data aggregation is enabled for all series.

2. Specify aggregation [method](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/aggregation/#method) (optional).    
In this demo, the `sum` method is used.
