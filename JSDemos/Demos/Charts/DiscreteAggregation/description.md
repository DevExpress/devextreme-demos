The aggregation algorithm depends on the **aggregateByCategory** property. In this demo, this property is set to **true** and applies the *"sum"* [aggregation method](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/aggregation/#method) for the groups specified in the **dataSource**. 

If **aggregateByCategory** is **false**, the specified aggregation method is not applied.
