In many cases, you need to process data on the server before the chart displays it. The Chart component supports this scenario. 

In this demo, the data source of the Chart loads weather data for a selected month from an OData service. Each time you select a different month in the drop-down menu, the data source sends a new query to the service. To implement this functionality, assign a [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/) object to the Chart [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#dataSource) property. 

In the [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/), implement an [ODataStore](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ODataStore/). This demo shows how to [expand](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#expand) used values and how to [postProcess](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#postProcess) them.

Set the [paginate](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#paginate) property to **false** to prevent data from partitioning. You can also apply [filter](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#filter) to the received values.

Once you load the data, specify the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) type and its nested options: [argumentField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#argumentField) and [valueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#valueField), so the component can determine which object fields in the data source indicate Chart arguments and values.
