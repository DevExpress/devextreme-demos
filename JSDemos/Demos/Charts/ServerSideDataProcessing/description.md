In&nbsp;many cases, before being handed out to&nbsp;the client, data is&nbsp;processed on&nbsp;the server. The DevExtreme JavaScript UI components support this scenario. In&nbsp;this demo, the data source of&nbsp;the Chart component loads weather data for a&nbsp;selected month from an&nbsp;OData service. Each time the month is&nbsp;changed, the data source sends a&nbsp;new query to&nbsp;the service.
