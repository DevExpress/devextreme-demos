This example demonstrates how you can connect the **Chart** and **RangeSelector** UI components in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;zoom into the appropriate data range within the **Chart**. Move the sliders along the **RangeSelector**, and you will note that the value axis of&nbsp;the **Chart** is&nbsp;adjusted automatically.
