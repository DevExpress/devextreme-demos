To display multiple PieChart components that share [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/Configuration/series/) and [legend](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/Configuration/legend/) settings, you can use an `*ngFor` notation to iterate through every PieChart option.

When you display PieChart components side by side, their pies may differ in size. To eliminate these differences, you can collect all charts in a single size group. To do this, set the charts [sizeGroup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/Configuration/#sizeGroup) property to identical values.
