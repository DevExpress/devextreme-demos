To display multiple PieChart components that share [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/Configuration/series/) and [legend](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/Configuration/legend/) settings, you can use a `v-for` notation to iterate through every PieChart option.

When you display PieChart components side by side, their pies may differ in size. To make their sizes identical, you can join all charts in a size group. To do it, set the [sizeGroup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPieChart/Configuration/#sizeGroup) property of every chart to the same value.
