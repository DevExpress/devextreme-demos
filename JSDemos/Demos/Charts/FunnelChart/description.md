The DevExtreme JavaScript Funnel Chart visualizes a&nbsp;value at&nbsp;different stages. It&nbsp;helps assess value changes throughout these stages and identify potential issues. In&nbsp;this demo, the Funnel shows the percentage of&nbsp;website users that performed a&nbsp;certain action: downloaded a&nbsp;trial, contacted support, purchased a&nbsp;subscription, etc. The chart shows that most users decided not to&nbsp;subscribe after contacting support. You can use this information to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;decision, for example, to&nbsp;provide extra training for the support team.
