As&nbsp;the **Chart** assigns one color to&nbsp;one series by&nbsp;default, you need to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;separate series for each bar to&nbsp;color bars differently. For this, employ a&nbsp;series template. Choose a&nbsp;data field and assign it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the **seriesTemplate**&nbsp;| **nameField** property. Each different value from this data field generates a&nbsp;separate series. In&nbsp;this demo, all values from the _&quot;age&quot;_ data field are different, therefore, a&nbsp;separate series is&nbsp;generated for each, and all series are colored differently.
