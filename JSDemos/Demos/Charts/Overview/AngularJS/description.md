DevExtreme JavaScript Charts is a library of adaptive chart components available as AngularJS directives. In addition to the common line, bar, and pie charts, the library includes such specialized charts as treemap, bubble chart, polar and radar charts, and many more. All charts support two-way binding to scope properties and behave like native components.
