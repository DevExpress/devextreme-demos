Spline charts, like [line charts](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Charts/Spline/jQuery/Light/), allow you to visualize data and display them as lines with points placed over specified intervals. However, spline charts smooth out individual lines that connect data points. 

In this example, you can switch through the Spline, Stacked Spline and Full-Stacked Spline charts. A Stacked Spline chart visualizes multiple data series and allows you to compare the manner in which each series contributes to the total aggregate value for specific arguments. A Full-Stacked Spline chart helps compare the percentage value of multiple line series for each argument. You can use the drop-down menu under the chart to switch between spline chart types mentioned above.

## Configure Series Type

The series type defines the appearance of your chart. To display a Spline, Stacked Spline, or Full-Stacked Spline series, set the [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#type) property to one of these types.
