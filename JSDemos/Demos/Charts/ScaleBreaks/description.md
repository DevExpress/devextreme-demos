A scale break is a wavy stripe on a chart plotting area. It is used to display the break in continuity between too low and too high values on an axis. Scale breaks improve the readability of chart sections with large gaps in their ranges.

The Chart component can generate scale breaks of the [valueAxis](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/). The Chart detects large gaps between side-by-side points, cuts them out, and puts scale breaks instead. Scale breaks are available for *'continuous'* or *'logarithmic'* [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#type) axes only.

To enable auto-calculated scale breaks, set the [autoBreaksEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#autoBreaksEnabled) property to `true`. Use the [maxAutoBreakCount](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#maxAutoBreakCount) property to limit the amount of automatically created scale breaks. To configure scale break appearance, use the [breakStyle](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/breakStyle/) object. You can test all these options in the demo.

You can also create custom breaks, including breaks of the [argumentAxis](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/). Use the [breaks](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/breaks/) array to declare a scale break collection. Each object in this array must have the [startValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/breaks/#startValue) and [endValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/breaks/#endValue) fields that limit a single scale break. A scale break range should be at least two tick intervals. Otherwise, the break might not be visible.
