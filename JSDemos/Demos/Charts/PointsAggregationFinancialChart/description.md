The **Chart** widget can aggregate data represented by series points. To enable this feature, set the **aggregation**.[enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/aggregation/#enabled) option of a [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/) to **true**. 

In this demo, the chart's [visual range](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/visualRange/) depends on the [RangeSelector](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/)'s settings (see the [onValueChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/#onValueChanged) handler). When the selected range is reduced, the series automatically becomes less aggregated. To change this behavior and set the fixed aggregation degree, specify the [aggregationInterval](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/aggregationInterval/) option of an axis.

Refer to the [aggregation](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/aggregation/) option description to see possible options for different series types.
