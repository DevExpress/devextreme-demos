The **Chart** widget can aggregate series points. To enable this feature, set the **aggregation**.[enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/aggregation/#enabled) option of a [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/) to **true**. 

In this demo, the **Chart** is bound to the [RangeSelector](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/) component. The wider you set the selection range, the higher aggregation degree the control uses, and vice versa.

Aggregation on zoom is one of many possible use cases for this feature. Refer to the [aggregation](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/aggregation/) description for information on how to configure aggregation for other scenarios.
