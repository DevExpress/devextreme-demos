You can populate the Chart component with data locally or remotely. If you do not need to get data from the server or update data dynamically, bind the component to a local JavaScript array. To bind Chart to a local array, pass this array to the Chart's [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#dataSource) property. 

Then, specify the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) type. Each [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/) type has the [argumentField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#argumentField) and the [valueField](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#valueField) properties. If you specify these properties, the component can determine which object fields in the array indicate Chart arguments and values. The default values for these properties are `arg` and `val` respectively. You can use these data field names to structure your array as shown in this demo.
