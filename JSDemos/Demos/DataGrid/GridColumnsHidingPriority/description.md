**DataGrid** automatically adapts its layout to screens of different widths. If screen width is not enough to display all columns, the widget hides them one by one. Set the [columnHidingEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#columnHidingEnabled) option to **true** to enable this feature.

You can also specify the order in which **DataGrid** hides the columns. Use a column's [hidingPriority]() option for this purpose. The lower is this option's value, the sooner a column is hidden. For example, **DataGrid** hides the column whose **hidingPriority** equals *"0"* first, then the column with the priority *"1"* and so on.
