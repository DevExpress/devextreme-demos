To configure group summaries, populate the [summary](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/).[groupItems](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/) array with summary configuration objects. Each object should specify a [column](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/totalItems/#column) that supplies data for summary calculation and a [summaryType](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/totalItems/#summaryType)&mdash;an aggregate function that should be applied to this data.

### Position a Group Summary

Group summaries are displayed in parentheses after the group caption. You can reposition them as follows:

* Display a summary in a column          
You can align a summary with the column by which it was calculated (see the Sale Amount and Total Amount columns). To do this, enable the [alignByColumn](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/#alignByColumn) property. If you want to align a summary with a column of your choice, specify it in the [showInColumn](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/#showInColumn) property.

* Move a summary to the group footer       
To position a summary in the group footer, enable the [showInGroupFooter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/#showInGroupFooter) property. The summary will be aligned with the column by which it was calculated (see the Total Amount column). If you want to use another column, specify it in the [showInColumn](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/#showInColumn) property.

### Format Summary Values
You can specify a text for the summary value. For this, specify it in the [displayFormat](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/#displayFormat) property (see the summaries of type *"sum"* and *"count"*). You can also set a custom display format for a summary item value in the [valueFormat](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/groupItems/#valueFormat) property (see the summaries for the Total Amount and Sale Amount columns).

### Sort Groups by Summary Values
The DataGrid sorts groups by their captions. To sort them by summary values, populate the [sortByGroupSummaryInfo](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/sortByGroupSummaryInfo/) array with objects. Each object should include the [summaryItem](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/sortByGroupSummaryInfo/#summaryItem) property that specifies a group summary item by which to sort groups. In this demo, the **sortByGroupSummaryInfo** array contains a single object that sorts groups by the number of orders.
