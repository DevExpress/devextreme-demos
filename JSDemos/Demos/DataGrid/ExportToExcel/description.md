The DataGrid makes it&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;export your data to&nbsp;an&nbsp;Excel file. Data is&nbsp;exported as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;displayed in&nbsp;the DataGrid: sorting, filtering and grouping are applied &mdash; while numbers, dates and associated formatting is&nbsp;maintained. In&nbsp;this demo, you can export selected rows by&nbsp;selecting _Export selected rows_ in&nbsp;the _Export_ button&rsquo;s dropdown.
