DevExtreme provides a utility that integrates its UI components with [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs#exceljs) (an Excel document customization library). In this demo, this utility is applied in the **onExporting** event handler and used to add a custom **header** and **footer** and other customization to an Excel document exported from the **DataGrid**.
