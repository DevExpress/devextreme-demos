You can apply custom templates to columns. For this, use the [cellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#cellTemplate) option. If you need to customize certain cells based on their values, implement the [onCellPrepared](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onCellPrepared) function.

In this demo, we have applied a custom template to the *Dynamics* column. It displays a line graph that illustrates changes of the currency rate over time. For this, the [Sparkline](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/) widget has been used. We have also customized individual cells. If their data object has the *"diff"* field, we formated the objects values and displayed them with individual css styles.
