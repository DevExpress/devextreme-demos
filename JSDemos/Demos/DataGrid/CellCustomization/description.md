You can apply custom templates to columns in order to change their data cells. For this, use the [cellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#cellTemplate) option.

In this demo, we have applied a custom template to the *Open*, *Close*, *High*, and *Low* columns. As a result, they display formated values of the data objects. We have also used another template with the *Dynamics* column: it uses the [Sparkline](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/) widget to display a line graph.
