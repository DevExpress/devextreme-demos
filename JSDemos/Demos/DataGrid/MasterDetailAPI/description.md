The **DataGrid** UI component ships with an&nbsp;API that allows you to&nbsp;implement your own logic when expanding/collapsing master-detail rows. In&nbsp;this example, only one row can be&nbsp;expanded at&nbsp;any point in&nbsp;time. This behavior is&nbsp;achieved using the **expandRow(key)** and **collapseAll()** methods called in&nbsp;the **onSelectionChanged** event handler.
