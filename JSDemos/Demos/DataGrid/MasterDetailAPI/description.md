The DataGrid ships with an API that allows you to implement a custom expand/collapse logic for master-detail rows. In this example, you can expand only one row at a time. To achieve this, we used the [expandRow(key)](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#expandRowkey) and [collapseAll(groupIndex)](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#collapseAllgroupIndex) methods inside the [onSelectionChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onSelectionChanged) event handler.
