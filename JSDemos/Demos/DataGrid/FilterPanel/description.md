The [Filter panel](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterPanel/) is a UI element that displays the combined filter. This filter is stored in the [filterValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterValue) option and consists of filters that users apply in other UI elemens ([filter row](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterRow/), [header filter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/headerFilter/), [filterBuilder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilder)).

To display the filter panel, set the **filterPanel**.[visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterPanel/#visible) option to **true**. 

A click on the combined filter calls the integrated filter builder. You can configure it in the [filterBuilder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilder) object. In this demo, this object is used to add the `weekends` [custom filter operation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/customOperations).

The intergrated filter builder is displayed in a pop-up window (the DevExtreme [Popup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/) UI component). Its default configuration is defined automatically, but you can change it in the [filterBuilderPopup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilderPopup) object. In this example, this object is used to specify the [position](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/Configuration/#position) of the pop-up window.
