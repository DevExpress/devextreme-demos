[Filter panel](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterPanel/) is a UI element that displays a filter expression. This expression consists of all filters that users apply in the [filter row](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterRow/) and [header filter](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/headerFilter/). A click on the filter expression calls the integrated filter builder. You can configure it in the [filterBuilder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilder) object. 

To display the filter panel, set the **filterPanel**.[visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/filterPanel/#visible) option to **true**. 

In this demo, we configure the `Weekends` [custom operation](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/customOperations) that applies to data of the *"date"* [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/customOperations/#dataTypes). The [calculateFilterExpression](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/customOperations/#calculateFilterExpression) function returns the filter expression to be displayed in the filter panel. Users should not be able to edit this operation in UI, so the [hasValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/customOperations/#hasValue) option is disabled.

**DataGrid** uses the DevExtreme [Popup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/) component to display a filter builder. The popup's default configuration is defined automatically. If this configuration does not meet your requirements, you can redefine it in the [filterBuilderPopup](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#filterBuilderPopup) option. In this example, this option is used to specify the popup's [position](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/Configuration/#position).
