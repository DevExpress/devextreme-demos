**DataGrid** automatically adapts its layout to screens of different widths. Use buttons in the top right corner to switch between the mobile and tablet screens. If columns do not fit the screen, the widget hides them one by one from right to left. 

To enable this behavior in your application, set the [columnHidingEnabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#columnHidingEnabled) option to **true**.
