**DataGrid** state can be persistent - if a user sorts and filters data, groups, reorders and resizes columns or makes other changes, then the widget saves these modifications and restores them when a user reloads the page. The full list of modifications that can be saved is in the [stateStoring](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/) documentation.

To enable state persistence, set **stateStoring**.[enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#enabled) to **true** and specify the [storageKey](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#storageKey) and [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#type) options. Depending on the type, the state can be saved to a [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) or [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage). With localStorage, the state persists across browser sessions; with sessionStorage, it is reset after the current session. This demo uses localStorage.

Alternatively, you can create a custom storage and implement the [customSave](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customSave) and [customLoad](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customLoad) functions if you need to store data in accordance with a custom logic.
