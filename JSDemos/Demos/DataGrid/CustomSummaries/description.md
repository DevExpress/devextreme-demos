The DataGrid support custom summary calculation. In&nbsp;this example, summaries are only calculated against selected grid rows. This behavior is&nbsp;implemented using the [calculateCustomSummary](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/summary/#calculateCustomSummary) and [onSelectionChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onSelectionChanged) properties.
