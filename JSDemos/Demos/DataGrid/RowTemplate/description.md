**DataGrid** rows support custom templates to display any content.

In this demo, a custom row template is assigned to the [rowTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#rowTemplate) ([rowRender](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#rowRender) in React) to display the employee's image and their information in a two-row table.
