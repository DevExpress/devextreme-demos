The **DataGrid** UI component supports the master-detail interface. This interface supplies a&nbsp;standard data row with an&nbsp;expandable section that contains detail data rows. Master-detail data representation is&nbsp;configured using the **masterDetail** object. In&nbsp;this example, each data row is&nbsp;supplied with a&nbsp;detail section that contains another **DataGrid** UI component.
