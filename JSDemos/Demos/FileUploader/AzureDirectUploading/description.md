The **FileUploader** UI component supports direct-upload to blob storages. This demo illustrates how to configure the [uploadChunk](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#uploadChunk) property to upload a large file directly to Azure Blob Storage without using a user's web server. All APIs that implement access to Azure Blob Storage on the client are stored in the <a href="https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/JSDemos/Demos/FileUploader/AzureDirectUploading/azure-file-system.js" target="_blank">azure-file-system.js</a> file.

To implement file upload logic, use the [uploadChunk](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#uploadChunk) property to specify how to process a connection request to the storage.
