This demo illustrates the Popup component. Click the Details button under an employee picture to see what the Popup looks like. Here is how you can configure its main elements:

- **Content**        
Use the [contentTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#contentTemplate) property to set the Popup content. 

- **Title Bar**       
Set [showTitle](Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#showTitle) to **true** and use the [title](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#title) property to specify the caption. 

- **Show and hide the Popup**      
Call the [show()](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Methods/#show) or [hide()](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Methods/#hide) method. If the Popup should be hidden on outside clicks, enable the [hideOnOutsideClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#hideOnOutsideClick) property.
