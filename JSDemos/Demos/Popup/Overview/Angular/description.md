This demo illustrates the Popup component. Click the Details button under an employee picture to see what the Popup looks like. Here is how you can configure its main elements:

- **Content**        
Put any valid markup inside the component. 

- **Title Bar**       
Set [showTitle](Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#showTitle) to **true** and use the [title](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#title) property to specify the caption. 

- **Show and hide the Popup**      
Use two-way binding to define the [visible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#visible) property and manipulate its value directly. If the **Popup** should be hidden on outside clicks, enable the [closeOnOutsideClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopup/Configuration/#closeOnOutsideClick) property.
