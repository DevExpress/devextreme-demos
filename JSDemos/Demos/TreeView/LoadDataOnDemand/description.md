If [virtual mode](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeView/VirtualMode/) does not suit your scenario, you can use the [createChildren](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#createChildren) function to specify custom logic to load data. This function is called each time a user expands a node that has not been expanded before. The node's identifier is passed to the function as an argument. Send this identifier to your data service that should return data for child nodes.
