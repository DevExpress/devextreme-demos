To bind the TreeView to a hierarchical array, assign it to the [items[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/items/) property. If you need to use a [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/) object and its diverse API, specify the [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#dataSource) property instead.

No matter which property is used, each hierarchical node should include a `text`, a unique `id`, optional developer-defined fields, and an `items` array if a node nests others. If the **items[]** TreeView property is specified, fields from its API can also be included.

In this demo, we used the [items[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/items/) property and configured the [onItemClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#onItemClick) handler to display a corresponding picture when a leaf node is clicked. Specific nodes are [expanded](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/items/#expanded) and include custom `price` and `image` fields.
