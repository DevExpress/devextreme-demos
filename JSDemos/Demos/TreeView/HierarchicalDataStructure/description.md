To bind the TreeView to a local hierarchical array, assign this array to the [items[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/items/) property as shown in this demo. If you want to process the local array or bind the TreeView to remote data, you need to use the [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/) object and specify the [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#dataSource) property instead of **items[]**.

No matter which property is used, each hierarchical node should include a `text`, a unique `id`, optional developer-defined fields, and an `items` array if a node nests others. If the **items[]** TreeView property is specified, fields from its API can also be included.

In this demo, we used the [items[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/items/) property and configured the [onItemClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/#onItemClick) handler to display a corresponding picture when a leaf node is clicked. Specific nodes are [expanded](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/Configuration/items/#expanded) and include custom `price` and `image` fields.
