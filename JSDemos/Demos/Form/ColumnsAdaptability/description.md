The **Form** UI component can use different layouts depending on&nbsp;the screen width. The dependency between column count and the screen width is&nbsp;specified using the **colCountByScreen** option, which has a&nbsp;higher priority than the **colCount** and the **minColWidth** options. In&nbsp;this demo, the form is&nbsp;displayed using a&nbsp;4-column layout on&nbsp;wide screens and a&nbsp;2-column layout on&nbsp;narrow screens. Switch between the landscape and portrait layouts to&nbsp;see how the form looks on&nbsp;wide and narrow screens.
