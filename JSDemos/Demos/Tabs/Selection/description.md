This demo shows how to process tab selection and uses SelectBox and MultiView components to emulate the page content. Both these components are bound to Tabs, and vice versa.

You can use the following properties to configure the selection:

- [selectedIndex](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedIndex)    
The index of the selected item.

- [selectedItem](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedItem)    
The selected item.

- [selectedItems](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedItems)     
An array of selected items.

- [selectedItemKeys](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectedItemKeys)     
An array of selected items' keys.

- [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#selectionMode)     
Specifies whether the component enables users to select only a single item or multiple items.

- [onSelectionChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/Configuration/#onSelectionChanged)     
A function that is executed when a collection item is selected or selection is canceled.
