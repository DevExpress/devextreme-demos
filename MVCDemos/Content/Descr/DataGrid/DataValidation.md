The DataGrid UI component supports data validation against a set of predefined or custom validation rules. These rules are generated based on Data Annotations that decorate the model properties (see the _EmployeeValidation.cs_ file). For the validation to work, the DataGrid should be cast to the model type and its columns should be declared using the `AddFor()` method.
