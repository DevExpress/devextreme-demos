DevExtreme JavaScript Form is a jQuery-powered control for displaying data as a collection of label-editor pairs, where editors depend on the data type. It can be configured using strongly-typed HTML helpers (see Forms | Validation demo), which provides client-side validation based on Data Annotations by default. You can choose between Razor C\# and Razor VB syntax and use lambda expressions when configuring it. DevExtreme also provides more specialized controls, such as Filter Builder, Range Selector, Radio Group, and many more. See other demos in this section to learn how to add and configure these controls.
