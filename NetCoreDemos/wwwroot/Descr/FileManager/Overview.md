The DevExtreme ASP.NET Core FileManager control allows you to display and manage files and directories for different file systems. The FileManager control uses file system providers to access file systems.
Use the [fileSystemProvider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/Configuration/#fileSystemProvider) property to configure the control's file system provider. The ["File System Types"](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/FileManager/BindingToFileSystem/NetCore/Light) demo group illustrates how to use the FileManager control with different file system providers.

The control's default security settings provide read-only access to files and directories. Use the [permissions](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/Configuration/permissions) property to deny or allow a user to copy, create, move, delete, rename, upload, and download files and directories. You can also specify file restrictions: allowed file extensions ([allowedFileExtensions](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/Configuration/#allowedFileExtensions)), chunk size ([chunkSize](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/Configuration/upload/#chunkSize)) and maximum file size ([maxFileSize](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/Configuration/upload/#maxFileSize)).

Use the control's [itemView](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/Configuration/itemView/) property or the view switcher on the toolbar to display file system items as a detailed list or customizable thumbnails.
