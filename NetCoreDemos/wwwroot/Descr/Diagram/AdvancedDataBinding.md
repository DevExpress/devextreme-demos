The Diagram component accepts functions as expression property values.  It allows you to implement custom logic when you bind a diagram to a data source.
In this demo, the [Nodes](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramBuilder.Nodes(System.Action-DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramNodesBuilder-)) and [Edges](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramBuilder.Edges(System.Action-DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramEdgesBuilder-)) collections are bound to a data source. Custom functions are used to get different shape types and font styles for items based on additional data source information.

The [AutoLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramNodesBuilder.AutoLayout.overloads) method specifies an auto-layout algorithm type and orientation that the component uses to build diagrams.
