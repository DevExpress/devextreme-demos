The Diagram component provides shapes with images that are specially designed for use in OrgCharts. You can select a shape with the following image positions: on the left, right, or top of the shape. 

In this demo, the Diagram is bound to a data source. The [ImageUrlExpr](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramNodesBuilder.ImageUrlExpr.overloads) property specifies the name of a field that provides a path to images.
