The Diagram component allows you to bind a [CustomShapes](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramBuilder.CustomShapes%28Action-CollectionFactory-DiagramCustomShapeBuilder--%29) collection to a data source. In this demo, the collection is bound to an array of employee objects. The Diagram creates a shape for every employee data item in the data source and adds the shapes to the "employees" category.  

The [Toolbox](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramBuilder.Toolbox%28System.Action-DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.Builders.DiagramToolboxBuilder-%29) method allows you to add custom categories to a data toolbox. 

Users can drag data items from the toolbox and drop them onto a canvas to create a diagram.
