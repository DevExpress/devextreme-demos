DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Controls include a collection of jQuery-powered server-side components used to represent data collections and allow a user to perform various actions on the view. You can configure each UI component with Razor C\# or Razor VB syntax, and use them in MVC views as well as in Razor Pages (introduced in .NET Core 2.0).
