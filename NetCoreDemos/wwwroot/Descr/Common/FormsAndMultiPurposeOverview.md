DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Form is a jQuery-powered data-editing control with a customizable layout. It supports strongly-typed HTML helpers (see Form | Validation demo), which provides client-side validation based on Data Annotations by default, and can be configured with Razor C\# or Razor VB syntax. In addition, DevExtreme Form can be used in Razor Pages (introduced in .NET Core 2.0). DevExtreme provides other UI components, like Filter Builder, Range Selector, Radio Group, which are more specialized. View other demos in this section to learn their application.
