# DevExtreme Demos
 
This repository contains technical DevExtreme demos for Angular, React, Vue, jQuery, ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Core.

To run the demos on your machine, clone this repository, run `npm install`, and follow the instructions below.

## Prepare Demos for Development

To prepare demos for development, you can run a script for all technologies or scripts for JavaScript and ASP.NET individually:

```
npm run prepare-all
```
```
npm run prepare-js
```
```
npm run prepare-mvc
```

Angular, Vue, and React demos can use bundles instead of separate files from `node_modules`. With bundles, demos launch faster but become harder to debug. Run the following command to create the bundles and replace the SystemJS configuration:

```
npm run prepare-bundles
```

To return to using separate files from `node_modules`, run `npm run prepare-js`.


## JavaScript Demos

### Launch

1. Run the launch script:

    ```
    npm run launch-demo
    ```

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

You can pass additional parameter to specify port. It can be useful when you need to fast switching beatween one demo on different frameworks:

```
npm run launch-demo -- 3010
```

### Before Commiting Ð¡hanges

For fix autofixed errors:

```
npm run fix-lint
```

### Development

1. Run the following script to add a new demo:

    ```
    npm run add-demo
    ```

1. Use the built-in CLI to choose or enter the category, the demo name, and the technology for the new demo.

## ASP.NET Demos

1. You will need Windows. Enable Developer Mode so that the `mklink` command doesn't require elevation. Refer to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.

1. In the `mobile` repository:
   - Run `PrepareWorkspace.cmd`.
   - Then, run the following commands:
     ```
     cd GitHub
     npm run build
     ```
     Or run `Packer.cmd`.

1. Open the `repository.config.json` file and set the `hg` property to a path where your clone of the `mobile` repository is located, for example:

    ```json
    {
      "hg": "C:/Work/mobile"
    }
    ```

1. Prepare ASP.NET demos for launch and development:

    ```
    npm run prepare-all
    ```

1. Open the ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core project in Visual Studio and add or edit demos there.
